###Structure and logic

The gift guide structure will be a simple quiz, which asks questions then gives a suggestion of what might be a suitable gift to buy.

- HTML file for basic user interface
- CSS file for appearance, matching main site
- JS file for interactive functionality

Questions will have multiple choice answers
Users pick one choice (for simplicity at this stage; future versions would allow multiple choices)
Each choice has a weighting i.e. a number attached to it
The script will add this up to provide a score
The score will determine which product/category is shown in the Results div

User path:
Click Gift Guide link to navigate to page
Read title and introduction
Read first question; pick an option
Repeat for all five questions
Click Results button
View results (two products and one category options)
Click an option to be taken to that product page in the shop pages
Or click Clear button to restart the quiz

I would like an option to email the results to them with a discount code - future dev!
