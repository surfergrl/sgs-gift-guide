# Validation and Testing

## HTML run through W3C validator

Errors on index.html:
![Validator](assets/images/readme/valid-index.png)

- Widths for the logo and main image had px specified when that was not needed. Deleted.
- Section for the logo was changed into a div element at the validator's suggestion.
- Span links were removed as not necessary.
- Added closing tags for links in the correct place (footer).
- The validator threw errors for the code copied from the CSS validator to display the 'Valid CSS' image. I deleted this altogether.
  Now validates.

Similar errors showed up on the Contact Us and Events page as Index was used as a template for the other pages.

### CSS run through Jigsaw

One error was found with text-wrap property given a pixels value; this was changed to 'wrap'.

<p>
    <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator">
        <img style="border:0;width:88px;height:31px"
            src="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss"
            alt="Valid CSS!" />
    </a>
</p>

### Conclusion

The user stories are broadly matched by the functionality of the site, but some areas do not yet have enough information. As the club develops this information will be created and can be uploaded as relevant. A new page for policies and coach information would be the next step, as well as a gallery for more sponsor visibility and exposure of club members and successful events.

For now, the site is able to give the basic information users require, and allows them to contact the club with any further questions. Future developments will build on this foundation.
